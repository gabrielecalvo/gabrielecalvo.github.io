# Shadow Flicker AI model

I had the chance to attend the last Wind Europe Annual Conference thanks to contributing to the 
*Dynamic Flicker Optimisation System*.

It is a very interesting project using neural network to detect periods of clear sky and prevent shadow flicker.

The [poster presentation](https://windeurope.org/annual2022/conference/posters/PO217/) is available online on the 
Wind Europe website, so if you are interested in hearing me describe the system, that's your chance. ðŸ˜‹
