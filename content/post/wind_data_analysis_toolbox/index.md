# Wind Data Analysis Toolbox

I've been working on a couple of python libraries that simplify some aspects of wind analysis:
- [WindDataDownloader](https://github.com/gabrielecalvo/wind_data_downloader): simplifies dowloading of MERRA2 and NCDC data.
- [windtools](https://github.com/gabrielecalvo/windtools): currently only handing wind rose generation.
