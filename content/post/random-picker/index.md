When working in a team, often we often rotate roles. For example to organise a monthly meeting or a weekly presentation.

Some teams use a more fully fledged, database-backed, wheel like [this one](https://github.com/aws/aws-ops-wheel), but if you are looking for something simpler and without the need to spin up databases and servers, then this tool I created might be a good option: https://github.com/gabrielecalvo/random-picker
