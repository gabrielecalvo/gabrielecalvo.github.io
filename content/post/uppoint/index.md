In the summer of 2020 I have been spending some free time developing a collaborative decision-making webapp called ["Uppoint"](http://35.231.251.20).

The elevator pitch goes something like this:

> Instead of degrading into quarrels 😡 or leaving it to the loudest 📣individual, let the group see all the options 📜 and let each voter order them by preference ☝️. Our system will do the rest 😉
> Some Features:
> - Ability to allow a set number of vetos ❌
> - Local 📍 or remote 📧 voting
> - Election status page 📊
> - 5 voting methods ⚙️ to choose from

You can find it at [uppoint.hopto.org](http://uppoint.hopto.org/)!
