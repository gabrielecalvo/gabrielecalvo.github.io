# Language4Water Python Course for Beginners
[L4W](http://4water.org/glasgow/language/) is a charity that organises language courses whose profit go towards providing world's poorest people with access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene services.

I heard about it a few years ago from a friend and have joined as a student and I decided to ask if they were interested in having a programming language as a course. They were very nice and open to it so here I am now teaching python to beginners.

I am constantly changing and refining the material [here](https://github.com/gabrielecalvo/Language4Water). And the previous courses can be found in the "archive" folder.
