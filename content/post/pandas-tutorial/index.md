During my previous job, I was constantly trying to push for more adoption of python and its awesome libraries. As a Data Analyst, the main one was obviously [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)!

In order to get people more familiar and confident using the internal tools and libraries I decided to prepare training material focused on pandas. The tutorial goes throught the main features of pandas and includes exercises and a final capstone project to test your skills.

You can find the material [here](https://github.com/gabrielecalvo/pandas_tutorial) under MIT Licence.
