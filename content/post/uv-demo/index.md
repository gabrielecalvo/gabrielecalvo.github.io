Today I've given a demo of `uv` at the Python meetup.

If you haven't already, you should check [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) out as it is a great tool the folks at Astral have developed.
It is a single tool that acts as: python version manager, virtual env manager, python global tooling managers, dependency-aware standalone script runner and more.

I've put my minimal guide here: https://github.com/gabrielecalvo/uv-demo

Happy pythoning
