As a Data Analyst, the main one was obviously &lt;a class="link" href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>pandas&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to get people more familiar and confident using the internal tools and libraries I decided to prepare training material focused on pandas. The tutorial goes throught the main features of pandas and includes exercises and a final capstone project to test your skills.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can find the material &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/gabrielecalvo/pandas_tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a> under MIT Licence.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Python Course @ Language4Water</title><link>https://gabrielecalvo.github.io/p/python-course-@-language4water/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabrielecalvo.github.io/p/python-course-@-language4water/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://gabrielecalvo.github.io/p/python-course-@-language4water/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post Python Course @ Language4Water" />&lt;h1 id="language4water-python-course-for-beginners">Language4Water Python Course for Beginners&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="http://4water.org/glasgow/language/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>L4W&lt;/a> is a charity that organises language courses whose profit go towards providing world&amp;rsquo;s poorest people with access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I heard about it a few years ago from a friend and have joined as a student and I decided to ask if they were interested in having a programming language as a course. They were very nice and open to it so here I am now teaching python to beginners.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am constantly changing and refining the material &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/gabrielecalvo/Language4Water" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>. And the previous courses can be found in the &amp;ldquo;archive&amp;rdquo; folder.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
